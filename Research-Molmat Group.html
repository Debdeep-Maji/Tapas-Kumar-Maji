            <p>The world today stands at a crucial juncture where on one hand, new smart materials are being developed every day, while on the other global warming and energy crisis is knocking on our doors. At MolMat Lab, we try to fight the major problems in energy and environment with the design and synthesis of inorganic-organic hybrid materials (known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in bulk and nanoscopic forms and porous organic polymers (POPs). Armed with an expansive synthetic tool-kit, the group has made significant contributions on porous materials and has explored them for renewable energy and environmental applications.</p>
            <img src="TKM-300x266.jpg">
            <br>
            <p>Our group has been looking at different properties and applications of MOF materials and few of them are given below:<br>

                <b class="text-success">1) a) Energy storage:</b>
                We have been engaged in the synthesis of MOFs for improving of H2 and CH4 storage capacity which are renewable sources of energy. Systematic modifications of the pore surface can increase the H2/CH4–adsorbent interactions, which is of paramount importance for the storage at ambient conditions. We have succeeded in immobilizing alkali metal sites or high density pendent electronegative atoms on the pore surface in MOFs that lead to a very high value of ΔHads. Moreover, pore sizes which are comparable to the kinetic diameter of molecular hydrogen are very effective for increasing density of adsorbed hydrogen. Framework interpenetration is another strategy that interests us, in order to increase the storage capacity and density of the adsorbed hydrogen in the framework.<br>
                (Relevant Publications: Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 538; Chem. Mater., 2009, 21, 5860; Chem. Mater., 2009, 21, 5406; Inorg. Chem., 2012, 51, 7103; J. Mater. Chem., 2010, 20, 1322.)<br><br>

                <b class="text-success">b) Selective capture and separation of Carbon dioxide:</b>
                One of the major problems that we are interested in is the separation and sequestration of CO2 within porous structures, e.g., MOFs. Among the many strategies at our disposal, we have focussed on judiciously designing framework structures by incorporating polar functional groups like -F-, -OH-, -NH2 on the pore surface which can effectively interact with the quadrupolar CO2 molecules and subsequently affect adsorption selectivity. Hydrophobic MOFs based on fluorinated linkers are extremely effective in selective capture of CO2 which is paramount importance for separation of CO from flue gas mixture.
                We have devised an indigenous breakthrough setup based on a Mass Flow Controller and a Gas Chromatography setup to check the practical applicability of these porous materials in the separation of two gases. A column packed with the MOF is purged with the mixture of gases and the retention time of one of the gases based on selective adsorption is determined. We use the MOFs with high CO2 for the separation of CO2 from CO2/N2 mixture (V:V / 15: 85) based on the flue gas composition. They are also used for the separation of CO2 from CO2/CH4 mixture at ambient condition for natural gas purification as certain percentage of non-calorific CO2 is present in the CH4.<br>
                (Relevant publications from the group: Inorg. Chem., 2011, 50, 400; Eur. J. Inorg. Chem., 2010, 3762; Chem. Eur. J., 2012, 18, 237; Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 11038; Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 8106; Chem. Commun., 2012, 48, 8487; ACS Omega, 2018, 3, 2018.)<br><br>

                <b class="text-success">c) Adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons:</b>
                Small hydrocarbons C2H2 (acetylene), C2H4 (ethylene), C2H6 (ethane), C3H6 (propene) and C3H8 (propane) are very important chemical feedstock for many industrially important materials. C2H6 and C3H8 are used for the production of corresponding C2H4 and C3H6 through industrial scale cracking processes which are important starting materials for the preparation of polyethylene and polypropylene. The fractional distillation of olefin-paraffin separation is not an energy efficient process. Furthermore, separation and purification of C2H4 from C2H2 (1%) is also a highly challenging assignment in petrochemical industry as C2H2 poison the catalyst during the C2H4 polymerization. By exploiting the different adsorption enthalpy of olefin and paraffin toward functionalized pore surface or by tuning the channel window size of the MOF materials, we can demonstrate the separation and purification of different hydrocarbons at ambient conditions. We are also interested in the separation of BTEX isomers. All these C8 isomers are also very important raw materials for petrochemical industry.<br>
                (Relevant Publication from the group: Chem. Eur. J., 2016, 22, 6059; Chem. Commun., 2017, 53, 4907; ACS Omega, 2018, 3, 2018.)<br><br>

                <b class="text-success">d) Molecule based magnetic materials:</b>
                Our group has been the first to prepare a coordination polymer featuring S = ½ kagomé lattice which is of special interest because theoretical prediction showed that such systems should exhibit spin liquid or an even more exotic behaviour due to strong quantum spin fluctuations. We try to strategize the assembly of 2D magnetic layers of MA-[MB(CN)6]3- (MA= MnII, CoII, NiII; MB = FeIII, CrIII) into 3D porous frameworks by linking organic pillars that exhibited permanent porosity as well as tunable magnetic properties. These frameworks will demonstrate interesting guest responsive magnetic modulation with reversible change in Tc. The frameworks can also exhibit reversible guest induced magnetic phase transition. Or intermediate meta-magnetic properties can also be realized by post-synthetic metalation.<br>
                (Relevant publications from the group: Dalton Trans., 2012, 41, 5879; Dalton Trans., 2009, 5062; Dalton Trans., 2010, 39, 6947; Dalton Trans., 2009, 4426; Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 538; Chem. Mater., 2013, 25, 1673; Chem. Eur. J., 2016, 22, 7792; Dalton Trans., 2016, 15523.)<br><br>

                <b class="text-success">e) Opto-electronic materials:</b>
                Photo-luminescence properties in MOFs can be realized based on metal ions (like Lanthanide ions) or from the chromophoric linkers. Our group has been systematically working on tunable emission of MOFs by adopting both approaches. Tunable emissions including white light emission in MOFs have been realized by doping EuIII in TbIII MOFs by FRET processes. Emission can be realized and tuned by the guest molecules in the MOFs. It is also possible to get specific emissive responses in these MOFs via charge-transfer (CT) complexation. Anionic MOFs can also be used as a platform for sensitization of specific metal ion or can be used for capture of heavy metal ions, or transition metal cations and that can be recognized based on specific emission read out signalling.<br>
                (Relevant publications from the group: Chem. Commun., 2010, 46, 7906; Chem. Eur. J., 2012, 18, 5848; Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 2014, 53, 11772; Inorg. Chem., 2012, 51, 10089; Chem. Commun., 2016, 52, 2831,This work has been highlighted in Atlas of Science https://atlasofscience.org/; Chem. Commun., 2014, 50, 13567.)<br><br>

                <b class="text-success">2) Nanoscale MOFs & Related Composite Materials:</b>
                Scaling down MOFs to the nanoscale provides better solution processability which is essential for device fabrication and biological applications. Bola-amphiphilic organic molecules have long been known to self-assemble in water and other polar solvents into interesting nanostructures. We have been working on bola-amphiphilic chromophoric systems like oligo-p-phenyleneethynylenes (OPEs) with different alkyl or glycol side chains and their self-assembly with metal ions. We attempt to understand the growth mechanism of such nanoscale materials.
                In recent days, significant efforts have been dedicated to the fabrication and understanding of new composite materials by the integration of two types of active components which are individually well-studied functional materials. Based on a judicious integration of different functional materials, the composites mitigate the drawbacks of the individual species and result in novel and advanced properties based on the synergistic combination. We try to use the assembly of MOFs with materials like graphene oxide, laponite or amino clay to get enhanced activities in terms of adsorption, separation and water harvesting. Their large surface areas also promote the formation of membranes, which can be further used for facile device fabrication.<br>

            <p><b class="text-success">3) Coordination Polymer Gel:</b>
                Recently, coordination polymer gels (CPG) have emerged as soft and highly processable metal-organic hybrid materials where coordination of metal ions to a suitably designed LMWG results in various gel-nanostructures, such as fiber, ribbons, spheres, tubes, rods etc. Such soft organic–inorganic hybrids are highly promising since the incorporation of metal ions renders an opportunity to emulate their unique redox, optical, electronic and magnetic properties in supramolecular gels. Moreover, the enhance solution processability facilitates the easy fabrication of large-area and flexible displays and portable sensing-kits. Different low molecular weight gelator base linker (LMWG-L) chromopohore connected with metal-binding site through alkyl amide chains have been designed and synthesized. Tunable emission, including white light emitting gels, using mixed lanthanide based CPGs has been demonstrated. Based on the dynamic nature of the terpyridine and lanthanide coordination bonds, multi-stimuli responsive lanthanide based CPGs can be apprehended. The solution processability was explored by making white light LED based on this gels. Photocatalytic H2 production from water and CO2 reduction through synergistic metal-ligand interaction in CPG based soft processable materials is another major scientific endeavour of our group. Another work his group elegantly demonstrated C3-symmetric tripodal LWMG which can form hydrogel with nanosphere morphology and organogel with fibrous morphology. Interestingly the nanosphere hydrogel acts as a catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation reaction.<br>

                <b class="text-success"> 4) Organic Porous Polymers for Opto-electronic and Photo/Electrocatalytic Activity:</b>
                Conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are an intriguing class of conjugated extended polymeric systems with permanent porosity and high specific surface area. Apart from their low densities, they possess high thermal and chemical stabilities due to strong covalent linkages (C-C, C-N, C-O) between building units. Organic porous polymers, mainly CMPs, of different porosity can be realized from different organic nodes and linkers via C-C coupling. Such polymers can be exploited for H2 storage, selective capture of CO2, catalysis and energy transfer applications. CMPs are also used for in situ stabilization of metal nanoparticles for making new composite materials for electrocatalysis. Tetraphenylethene based conjugated microporous polymer can also show framework induced emission properties and can be further utilized for light harvesting or sensing applications.<br>
                (Relevant publications from the Group: Chem. Mater., 2012, 24, 969; Chem. Eur. J., 2012, 18, 4505; ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2014, 6, 4630; Chem. Commun., 2014, 50, 2015; Chem. Eur. J., 2015, 21, 10799; J. Phys. Chem. C, 118, 24369, 2014; Chem. Commun., 2019, 55, 2837.)<br>
                The major hindrance in the path of the widespread commercialization of fuel cells is the use of the expensive noble metal catalyst for the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). We aim at developing extremely efficient noble metal free purely organic systems or MOF derived carbon materials for excellent electrocatalytic activity. Synthesis of donor-acceptor conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) is a potential way to tune the band gap for increase the solar energy harvesting towards photochemical water splitting. Metal-free pristine CMP catalyzing electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is unprecedented. We are interested in developing a design strategy to fabricate electrochemically active CMPs by linking donor nodes and acceptor spacers. We fabricate electrochemically active CMPs by linking donor nodes (tri-phenylamine derivatives) and acceptor (biphenyl or tetraphenylethene) spacers and the resultant CMPs are expected show appreciable ORR activity and catalytic stability over time. These works have opened new vistas in the development of cost-effective and efficient catalysts for photo and electrochemical energy generation and conversion processes.<br>
